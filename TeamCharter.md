* **Primary Channel:** Discord
* **Weekly Meetings:** Every **Friday at 13:00** Kyiv time. Additional meetings between team members can be scheduled as needed.
* **Reply Expectation:** Team members are expected to reply within **24 hours**

## 4. Collaboration Workflow

* **Task Workflow:** Tasks are tracked on the **Kanban board** and should be small and atomic, completed within a few days. Larger features must be split into smaller tasks and delivered incrementally, ensuring fast reviews and continuous integration into `main`.
* **Branching Strategy:** GitHub Flow approach. The `main` branch is always stable and only updated via Pull Requests (PRs). Each new feature or bug fix is to be developed on a dedicated branch.These branches should be deleted promptly after successful merge to maintain clean and organized repository.
* **Branch Naming:** Use the format `type/#<issue-number>-short-description` (e.g., `docs/#3-teamcharter-setup`).
* **Commit Conventions:** Use semantic commits with an issue link. The format is `<type>(#<issue-number>): short message` (e.g., `docs(#3): add TeamCharter.md`).
* **Code Review Rules:** Each PR must  be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member before it can be merged.
* **Integration:** Merge branches into `main` frequently to avoid long-lived branches and large merge conflicts.

## 5. Conflict Resolution

We will follow a three-step process for resolving conflicts:

1. **Majority Vote:** We will first attempt to resolve disagreements through a majority vote among team members.
2. **Seek Compromise:** If a majority vote does not lead to a resolution, we will collectively propose and discuss potential compromises. A new vote will be held on the most viable compromise.
3. **Instructor Mediation:** As a last resort, if strong arguments persist and no compromise can be reached, we will escalate the issue to the course instructor for mediation.

## 6. Availability & Workload

All team members will aim for approximately **6 hours** of work **per week**. If a team member is overwhelmed and/or the workload becomes unbalanced, we will re-distribute tasks to ensure no one is overburdened. The team will prioritize a **healthy work-life balance** for all members.

## 7. Ethics

All team members will follow the **ACM Code of Ethics** and maintain strict **academic honesty** throughout the project.

* We agree not to plagiarize any code or documentation.
* We will treat other team members with respect.
