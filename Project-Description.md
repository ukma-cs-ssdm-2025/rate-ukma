# Project Description

## Project Idea

**Rate UKMA** is a web platform for students to share their experiences and feedback on university courses. Currently, student feedback is often shared by word-of-mouth or through anonymous survey that isn't visible to other students. This project aims to centralize that information, making it easier for students to make informed decisions about their academic path. The site will allow students to read reviews from their peers, see how a course has changed over time, and sometimes better understand the professor's teaching style, ultimately streamlining the course selection process.

## User Roles

* **Student:** A primary user who can view course information, submit ratings, and write reviews for courses they have completed.
* **Administrator (Admin):** A user with special permissions to manage course data, handle user accounts, and moderate content to ensure its integrity.

## High-Level Features

* **Course Rating & Review System:** Students can rate courses based on difficulty and usefulness, and leave detailed written reviews.
* **Search & Filter:** Users can search for and filter courses by various criteria, including department, professor, and average rating.
* **Interactive Analytics:** The platform will display charts and graphs showing course trends over time, such as changes in average ratings.
* **Anonymity:** The platform will guarantee anonymity for students, ensuring that professors cannot be biased against any student based on their reviews.
* **Possible Account Authentication:** Students will securely log in using their NaUKMA Outlook accounts. This helps verify that users are current students and allows us to match them with courses they have taken.
