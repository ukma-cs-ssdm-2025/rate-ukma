# ADR-N: Brief Decision Title

## Status

[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

* If deprecated, indicate why. If superseded, include a link to the new ADR.

## Date

YYYY-MM-DD

## Context

Describe here the forces that influence the design decision, including technological, cost-related, and project requirements. This should clearly state the problem or challenge we are facing.

**Example forces:**

* FR1 requires the ability for video streaming.
* NFR1 requires support for 10,000 concurrent streams.
* NFR2 requires a start-up time of < 3 seconds.

## Decision

Describe here our response to these forces, that is, the design decision that was made. State the decision in full sentences, using an active voice ("We will...").

**Example:**
We will use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) service with Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (using HLS/DASH protocols) for all video content delivery.

## Consequences

Describe here the resulting context after applying the decision. All consequences should be listed, not just the "positive" ones.

**Example:**

* ✅ Scales to millions of users
* ✅ Reduces bandwidth costs by 60%
* ✅ Improves global availability
* ⚠️ Requires a transcoding pipeline
* ⚠️ CDN costs scale with usage
* ❌ Limited control over edge behavior

## Considered Alternatives

List all alternatives that were seriously considered. Briefly explain why each rejected alternative was dismissed.

**Example:**

1. **Direct streaming from primary servers**
    * Rejection Reason: Cannot scale to 10K concurrent users.
2. **P2P (Peer-to-Peer) streaming**
    * Rejection Reason: Security concerns and unreliability/instability.
3. **Third-party service (YouTube, Vimeo)**
    * Rejection Reason: Limited control and branding issues.
