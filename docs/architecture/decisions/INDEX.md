# Architecture Decision Log

This document serves as the central index and log for all significant **Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** for our project.

## How to Work with ADRs

1. **To Add a New Decision:** Create a new Markdown file using the provided template (`template.md`) and name it sequentially (e.g., `adr-002.md`).
2. **To Update Status:** Update the `Status` field inside the specific ADR file (e.g., changing from `Proposed` to `Accepted` or `Deprecated`).
3. **To View:** Use the links in the **Decision Log** below to read the full context, rationale, and consequences for any recorded decision.
