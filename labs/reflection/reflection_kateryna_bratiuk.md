Teamwork ended up being one of the strongest parts of this project. We met every Friday, set weekly goals, and divided tasks in a way that was organized but still flexible when needed. The discussions about how the rating logic should work or how the analytics should look were genuinely interesting. Working together on a real domain model wasn’t always easy, but it was definitely rewarding.

Our communication inside the team felt very open and supportive. Everyone could ask questions, suggest ideas, or challenge existing ones without feeling uncomfortable. Even when the workload was heavy, the atmosphere stayed positive — we worked a lot, but we also laughed a lot, and sometimes even drifted into conversations about shows or anime.

Whenever we had different opinions, we solved them quickly through discussion or simple voting. I honestly cannot remember a single real argument. Being able to come to an agreement so smoothly really helped the project move forward.

Since I’m still learning many software development best practices, this project was a great chance to learn from the others. My teammates were always ready to help, explain something, or share advice, and that meant a lot to me. I felt like I was growing throughout the semester.

Working with such a motivated and professional group made this experience not just useful, but genuinely fun. I really believe our teamwork played a huge role in the success of the project.

I’m grateful for this course because it gave us the opportunity to build something meaningful together and to work as a real team. Even though this stage of development is done, we already have plans for what to add next: likes, comments, recommendations, more analytics, and plenty of other ideas. I’m excited to see how the project will grow and evolve.
