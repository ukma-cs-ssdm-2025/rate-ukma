# Rate UKMA: From Inspiration to Innovation - A Reflection

**By Andrii Valenia**

It all started with a simple idea. I recall seeing a document shared by a NaUKMA Buddy, detailing course ratings, which featured a 2D scatter plot visualizing usefulness against difficulty. In that moment, I was struck by its clarity and ease of interpretation. This initial spark led to the creation of Rate UKMA.

I had actually conceived the idea for Rate UKMA long before this project. However, combining a heavy workload at university with work, realising this idea seemed almost impossible — it was put on hold. Then came this course, which provided the perfect catalyst. It offered not just the opportunity, but a significant boost in knowledge for everyone seeking it. The process was tough, demanding a vast amount of time and effort to bring Rate UKMA to life, but the result was undoubtedly worth it.

Once the ideal scenario unfolded, great...the greatest! team ever was assembled and we embarked on this journey. From that scattered image in my head, every team member contributed significantly, transforming it into the functional application we have today. We even have beta-testers providing real ratings — a mix of fun, good, and bad, as with any genuine, honest feedback.

The entire path has been an incredibly rewarding experience. Starting from a blank slate, we progressively built out authentication, implemented a scraper and then witnessed the first data ingesting into the database. This led to the core functionality, numerous pipelines and engaging weekly meetings filled with productive discussions and laughter. I've improved my skills in task creation and management, learning how to effectively break down complex problems. My brainstorming abilities have significantly improved and I still fondly remember the "pizza pipeline" exercise from our first practical session – a truly enjoyable memory.

Technically, this project has been a fantastic playground for experimentation. It allowed me to explore new technologies and push the boundaries of what's possible with AI (I believe there's a lot more creative ways to do with that).

What truly resonated with me was the drive and dedication of every team member. It was incredibly gratifying to receive the first comments praising our UI/UX and functionality. Some users even delved into our pipelines and codebase, expressing genuine surprise and admiration about what we did.

This course has been an exceptional experience, allowing us to create something valuable and impactful, a project we are committed to continuing to evolve and improve.

## Responsibility in Design: Preventing Abuse

One ethical challenge that emerged was: how do we protect the platform from aggressive or harmful comments while preserving honest feedback? Anonymous reviews prevent bias, but they also make abuse easier. We discussed where to draw the line – what counts as aggressive versus critical but fair? We've aligned on our perspective as a team, but the hard part is implementation: how do we programmatically detect and filter harmful content without censoring legitimate criticism? This remains an open question we'll tackle as Rate UKMA evolves.
