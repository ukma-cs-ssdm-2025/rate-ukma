# Essay reflection (very informal)

I won't lie, I had a hard time working on the project at times, mainly due to the excessive workload in other subjects. However, what kept me motivated was the thought that we were creating something genuinely useful for other students. Honestly, I wish I had something like RateUKMA when I was choosing subjects in my first years. This vision and our visible progress were the main things that kept me going.

Speaking of progress, this was my first experience with "close-to-commercial" development, so almost everything was new (and not always exciting) to me. I spent a lot of time wrestling with the scraper to get clean data from our beloved SAZ. This actually raised one of the main ethical issues I faced. As I was responsible for the parser, I felt responsible for collecting the data and keeping it out of the public domain.

Another ethical aspect we considered was the fairness of the ratings. We wanted to create a transparent platform, but one where there was no unfair toxicity or “review bombing”. This is why RateUKMA has Microsoft authentication: to ensure that every rating comes from a real student. Moreover, we created an option to remain anonymous, so that students don’t have to be afraid to be honest.

Regarding the team, they were the best part of this project. One of the huge advantages was having people with relevant development experience in our group who were always there to help.

We respected each other's time and opinions, creating a friendly environment where everyone felt comfortable sharing ideas or ask questions. As the Documentation Lead, I am especially glad that our Team Charter wasn't just a piece of paper — we actually followed it. However, we didn’t really have any heated arguments, just minor disagreements that were easily resolved by voting.

Ultimately, working on RateUKMA felt meaningful, and I am proud to be a part of this project. We definitely plan to continue working on RateUKMA after the course ends as well to make it even better!
