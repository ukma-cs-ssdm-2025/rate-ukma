# Software Engineering Course Final Essay

One of the most valuable aspects of university education for me lies in the opportunity to work on interesting tasks and learn something new.

Speaking about teamwork, the project gave me the chance to work with genuinely talented and engaged classmates. During development, everyone invested their time and attention, motivation never had to be drawn out of anyone, everyone approached deadlines and their assigned tasks responsibly. Undoubtedly, I was lucky with the team in this regard.

Regarding ethical questions, there weren't any negatives either. If we couldn't reach some consensus, we'd simply settle it democratically through a poll. Overall, we had respect for each other and treated each other as equals in the process of decision making. We took into account each member's task preferences and strengths.

I'm sure our main advantage was that we came up with our own topic for the project. The one which we genuinely see as valuable and beneficial - and, as a result, this fueled us with motivation. We're planning to carry on with development even after the course, which definitely gave us the tools and crucial time frames for an effective start and process automation.

We treated the project as a real product, so we spent a large amount of time on it and went all out.

Another important factor that, I reckon, has contributed to comfortable teamwork, was the different work experience. We had team members who had hands-on experience with the tech stack, and those who were doing it for the first time - we could learn from each other, without slowing down the development pace.

I'm grateful to the project for finally allowing me to step into the DevOps position, for the team being proactive and polite, and for us now having a genuinely useful product in our portfolio (still in beta, but there`s much more in store!).
